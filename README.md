# Earphones-PluggedIn-Checker
My phone developed this problem where sometimes even if the earphones were plugged in it would not be detected and music or audio files would be played through the speakers. 
So I made this little utility app which would set the Media Volume as required (can be set on the slider)  whenever the Earphones are detected to be plugged in. And if the earphones ever lose connection, the Media Volume is automatically set to Zero so that no audio is played out loudly in a crowd. A Toast in displayed every time the earphones are detected to be plugged in or every time they lose connection. Later, I also added a link to the Music Player app installed on my phone so that I can open it's main activity straight from the Earphones Checker app.
This app can be extended further and the action of earphones being plugged in or out can be used to control various events.
I plan to update it to open whichever Music Player app is present on the phone by automatically detecting it(so that it can be universal and be used on any phone no matter which Music Player they have installed). Currently, I have accessed my Music Player using its static Package Address so it can't be applied to devices which have any different Music Player.

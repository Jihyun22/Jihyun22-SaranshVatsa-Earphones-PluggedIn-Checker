# Earphones-PluggedIn-Checker
My phone developed this problem where sometimes even if the earphones were plugged in it would not be detected and music or audio files would be played through the speakers. So I made this little utility app which would set the Media Volume as required (can be set on the slider)  whenever the Earphones are detected to be plugged in. And if the earphones ever lose connection, the Media Volume is automatically set to Zero so that no audio is played out loudly in a crowd. A Toast in displayed every time the earphones are detected to be plugged in or every time they lose connection. Later, I also added a link to the Music Player app installed on my phone so that I can open it's main activity straight from the Earphones Checker app.
